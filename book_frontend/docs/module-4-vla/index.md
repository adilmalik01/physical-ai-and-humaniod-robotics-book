# Module 4: Vision–Language–Action (VLA)

## Language-Driven Robotic Intelligence

Welcome to Module 4 of our Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics journey! In this final module, we'll explore the integration of vision, language, and action systems to create language-driven robotic intelligence for humanoid robots.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Implement speech-to-action pipelines with OpenAI Whisper
- Integrate LLM-based task planning for robot actions
- Create vision-guided manipulation systems
- Build end-to-end humanoid system integration
- Connect all components into a complete autonomous system

### Module Overview

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module focuses on creating an intelligent interface between human communication and robot action. This involves:
- Processing natural language commands
- Planning appropriate robot actions
- Executing vision-guided manipulation
- Creating seamless human-robot interaction

### Module Structure

This module contains several chapters that build upon each other:

- **Chapter 01**: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Systems
- **Chapter 02**: Speech Recognition with OpenAI Whisper
- **Chapter 03**: LLM-Based Task Planning
- **Chapter 04**: Vision-Guided Manipulation
- **Chapter 05**: End-to-End System Integration

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1-3 (ROS 2, simulation, AI-robot brain)
- A working ROS 2 installation
- Access to OpenAI API or similar speech recognition service
- Understanding of computer vision concepts

### Tools You'll Use

Throughout this module, you'll work with:
- OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition
- LLM APIs (OpenAI GPT, etc.)
- Computer vision libraries (OpenCV, Isaac ROS)
- ROS 2 manipulation packages
- Speech synthesis libraries

### Next Steps

Let's begin with [Chapter 01: Introduction to Vision-Language-Action Systems](./chapter-01.md) where you'll understand the fundamentals of connecting vision, language, and action in humanoid robotics.
