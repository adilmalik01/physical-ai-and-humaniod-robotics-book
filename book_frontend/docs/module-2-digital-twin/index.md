# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Simulation and Human-Robot Interaction

Welcome to Module 2 of our Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics journey! In this module, we'll explore the concept of digital twins and how physics-based simulation environments enable safe and efficient robot development.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the role of digital twins in Physical AI
- Create physics-based simulations using Gazebo
- Develop high-fidelity environments using Unity
- Implement sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth, IMU)
- Validate humanoid behavior before real-world deployment
- Connect simulation environments with ROS 2

### Module Overview

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that enable testing and validation without risk to actual hardware. For humanoid robots, simulation is critical because:
- Physical robots are expensive and can be damaged
- Safety testing must be performed before deployment
- Iteration cycles are much faster in simulation
- Training data can be generated synthetically

### Module Structure

This module contains several chapters that build upon each other:

- **Chapter 01**: Introduction to Digital Twins in Robotics
- **Chapter 02**: Gazebo Simulation Fundamentals
- **Chapter 03**: Creating Humanoid Robot Models for Simulation
- **Chapter 04**: Physics-Based Environment Design
- **Chapter 05**: Sensor Simulation and Integration

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- A working ROS 2 installation
- Basic understanding of physics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts (helpful but not required)

### Tools You'll Use

Throughout this module, you'll work with:
- Gazebo (Fortress or Garden)
- RViz2 for visualization
- URDF models from Module 1
- Gazebo plugins for sensors and physics
- Unity (optional, for advanced environments)

### Next Steps

Let's begin with [Chapter 01: Introduction to Digital Twins in Robotics](./chapter-01.md) where you'll understand the fundamental concepts of digital twin technology and its applications in humanoid robotics.
