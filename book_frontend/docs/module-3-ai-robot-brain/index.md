# Module 3: The AI–Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Perception and Navigation Intelligence

Welcome to Module 3 of our Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics journey! In this module, we'll explore how to build intelligent perception and navigation systems for humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac tools.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand synthetic data generation with Isaac Sim
- Implement accelerated perception with Isaac ROS
- Use navigation with Nav2 for humanoid robots
- Close the perception-to-action loop in humanoid robots
- Integrate AI models with robot control systems
- Create perception-driven autonomous navigation

### Module Overview

The AI-Robot Brain is where perception meets action. In this module, we'll focus on:
- Processing sensor data to understand the environment
- Using AI models to make intelligent decisions
- Planning and executing navigation tasks
- Creating robust perception-action loops

### Module Structure

This module contains several chapters that build upon each other:

- **Chapter 01**: Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac for Robotics
- **Chapter 02**: Isaac Sim for Synthetic Data Generation
- **Chapter 03**: Isaac ROS for Accelerated Perception
- **Chapter 04**: Navigation with Nav2 for Humanoids
- **Chapter 05**: Perception-to-Action Loop Implementation

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed Modules 1 and 2 (ROS 2 and simulation)
- A working ROS 2 installation
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Docker (for Isaac Sim)

### Tools You'll Use

Throughout this module, you'll work with:
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim
- Isaac ROS packages
- Navigation2 (Nav2)
- TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI models
- ROS 2 perception packages

### Next Steps

Let's begin with [Chapter 01: Introduction to NVIDIA Isaac for Robotics](./chapter-01.md) where you'll understand the NVIDIA Isaac ecosystem and its applications in humanoid robotics.
