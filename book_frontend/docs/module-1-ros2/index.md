# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Middleware and Humanoid Control Architecture

Welcome to the first module of our Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics journey! In this module, we'll establish the foundation of humanoid robot control by exploring ROS 2 fundamentals and real-time communication.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 fundamentals and real-time communication
- Create and manage nodes, topics, services, and implement modular design
- Bridge Python AI logic with ROS 2 using rclpy
- Model humanoid robot bodies using URDF
- Design a unified nervous system for humanoid robots

### Module Overview

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the nervous system for your humanoid robot, coordinating communication between various sensors, actuators, and processing units. This module will teach you how to create a robust middleware architecture that enables your robot to function as a unified system.

### Module Structure

This module contains several chapters that build upon each other:

- **Chapter 01**: ROS 2 Fundamentals and Installation
- **Chapter 02**: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- **Chapter 03**: Real-time Communication Patterns
- **Chapter 04**: Bridging AI Logic with ROS 2
- **Chapter 05**: Humanoid Body Modeling with URDF

### Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- A working Python environment (Python 3.8+)
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with command-line tools

### Tools You'll Use

Throughout this module, you'll work with:
- ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or later)
- Python 3.8+
- rclpy (Python client library for ROS 2)
- URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- RViz2 for visualization

### Next Steps

Let's begin with [Chapter 01: ROS 2 Fundamentals and Installation](./chapter-01.md) where you'll set up your ROS 2 environment and learn the core concepts that make ROS 2 the backbone of modern robotics systems.
