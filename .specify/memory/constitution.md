# AI-Humanoid & Physical AI Book with Integrated RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development
All content and features must trace back to written specifications; No implementation without corresponding spec; Every change originates from spec-first methodology.

### Technical Accuracy in AI and Robotics
All technical explanations must be based on verified AI and robotics concepts; No hallucinated references or unsupported technical claims; Strict adherence to established AI, Physical AI, and Humanoid Robotics domains.

### Clarity for Mixed Audience
Content must be accessible to AI students, developers, and hackathon evaluators; Technical concepts explained with practical examples; Clear demonstration of connection between AI software and physical robotic systems.

### Reproducibility
Book, code, and deployments must be repeatable from the repository; All processes documented and executable from scratch; Deterministic builds and deployments required.

### Practical Embodiment of AI Concepts
Bridging digital intelligence with physical systems; Real-world applications of AI concepts demonstrated; Theory connected to practice in embodied intelligence.

### Grounded RAG Responses
RAG chatbot responses must be grounded strictly in book content; Selected-text question answering must reference only user-highlighted content; No hallucination in chatbot responses.

## Key Standards

### Book Generation Standards
Book structure and content must be generated using Spec-Kit Plus workflows; Claude Code must be used for spec-driven authoring and iteration; Executable and documented code examples required.

### AI Terminology Consistency
AI terminology must be used consistently and correctly; Technical terms defined and used uniformly; Clear definitions provided for Physical AI, Embodied Intelligence, and Humanoid Robotics concepts.

### Technology Stack Requirements
Documentation framework: Docusaurus; Deployment target: GitHub Pages; Chatbot architecture using OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI backend, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud Free Tier.

### Content Scope Boundaries
Book content scope limited to Physical AI, Embodied Intelligence, and Humanoid Robotics (simulation and real-world concepts); No expansion beyond defined scope without constitutional amendment.

## Development Workflow

### Specification-First Approach
Every feature begins with written specification; Implementation follows spec approval; Changes to spec required before implementation changes.

### Code Quality Standards
All technical explanations based on verified concepts; Executable code examples with documentation; Consistent AI terminology usage throughout.

### Testing and Validation
All chapters generated via spec-driven workflow; Embedded RAG chatbot tested for accuracy against book content; Selected-text functionality validated against user-highlighted content.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices and guides all project decisions. All implementations must comply with these principles. Amendments require formal documentation, approval process, and migration plan when applicable. All contributions must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must be justified with clear benefits to the core mission of connecting AI software with physical robotic systems.
